##English GSCE Vocabulary Builder Desktop Application

###**Installation** 

Prerequisitives: Please make sure that you have JDK 11 installed on your computer 
and that it is added to your class-path list in your Environment Variables. 

###**Log in** 

The first screen when you open the application will always be the log in screen. Here, either create a new user 
account or choose an existing user account from the drop down menu. When creating your own user account, the following
criteria must be met: 
* The first name and last name combined should be unique. E.g. two 'John Smith's are not allowed, but a 'John Adams'
a 'John Smith' are fine.
* You must not enter a blank or a space as an entry. 

###**Starting off** 

Once you have logged in, you should see your name displayed at the top. 
If nothing is displayed under 'current unit', you will need to select a unit to learn. To do this, click on 'Select unit' 
button on the left navigation pane. This should take you to a page with a drop-down menu. Select one of the units from
the list in the drop down menu, and press 'Go'. Your newly selected unit, along with your attainment and difficulty 
level in that unit should now appear in the top tool-bar. 

Once a unit has been selected, other activity buttons 'Learn', 'Revise', 'Test Me' should now be activated. 
Although you can choose any of the activities to begin with, we recommend performing them in order: Learn, Revise, Test Me.
